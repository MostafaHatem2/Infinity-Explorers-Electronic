## 1. Three Stages Common Emitter Amplifier

This circuit demonstrates a basic multi-stage transistor amplifier using three common emitter configurations connected in series.

### Features:
- **Three amplification stages** for increased voltage gain.
- **Coupling capacitors** used to pass AC signals and block DC between stages.
- **Biasing resistors** keep each transistor in the active region for proper amplification.
- **Improved overall gain** through cascading.

### Applications:
- Audio signal pre-amplification
- Sensor signal amplification
- Low-level analog signal boosting

## 2. Class B Audio Amplifier

This circuit is designed to efficiently amplify audio signals using a push-pull pair of transistors operating in Class B mode.

### Features:
- **Push-pull configuration**: One transistor handles the positive half-cycle of the signal, and the other handles the negative half.
- **Higher efficiency** than Class A amplifiers.
- **Some crossover distortion** may occur at the zero-voltage point.

### Applications:
- Audio power amplifiers
- Home stereo and speaker systems
- Low-power radio frequency amplification

## Notes
- Both circuits are built using basic components (BJTs, resistors, capacitors, power supply).
- Simulations can be done using software like Multisim or LTspice.
- Breadboard testing is recommended before PCB design.
